# Teacher-s_website
At the beginning this project was conceived as a teacher's website for my mother, but later it turned out to be not so necessary and I abandoned it. Some time later, already in the first year of university, I remembered about this site and remade it for a student project. Who knows, maybe in the future it will come in handy again.
